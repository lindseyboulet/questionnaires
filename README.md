# Study Questionnaires with Persistent Data Storage

These are questionnaires used in human physiology studies, made using shinyR.  Each app stores questionnaire data in the folder in which the app is located. If data file is present, the app appends data to the present file. The *"studyQuestionnair.R"* is a typical study prescreening form. The *"lakeLouiseScore.R"* is a clinical test for altitude sickness (reference below).
